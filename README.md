# F1 2017 Telemetry with ESP32 and UDP Packets 🏁

Initial test of parsing UDP packets and displaying telemetry data from F1 2017 on PS4 to the [TTGO T-Display ESP32](http://www.lilygo.cn/claprod_view.aspx?TypeId=21&Id=1219). 

Code for parsing UDP packets is from this [paste](https://pastebin.com/S50RHbyV) found online. Rest of the code is added for WiFi connectivity, and code for the integrated TFT display.
